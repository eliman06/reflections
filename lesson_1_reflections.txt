How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
This is helpfuly because we can see he difference and compare the two files at the same time and look for the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I think its more efficient because if the programmer make a mistake, he can have access to the old versions of the file. In this way he have the functional entire file. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
The pros i think can it be if we dont have a lot of experience in version control software we can do in us way. The cons can it be if we lost a version file we have in problems because we dont have how get back. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
its more usefull, because when we have to make a change that affect multiple files. We can create a commit with this files and document wich were the changes!!!

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
well with the command git log we can see all done commits. And then when we have the two commits that we want  to compare we use the command git diff. In this way we can see all the done changes 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
the secret is in that we can come back to the old commits to see which were the changes and then we can back to the recent commit and fix out the mistakes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
i want o use git for my own projects.
